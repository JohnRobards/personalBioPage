        <h3>Desires</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Looking for a relaxing 24-hour guard-service position somewhere with a good view and plenty to eat. Would prefer a posh position
        where I simply look intimidating and growl every once in a while, though I'm not adverse to dismembering and then eating whatever may try to sneak past me. 
        A nice view of the sunset is preferred but not required. If you do not have sufficient dog treats for a giant three-headed dog, 
        INCLUDING a sizable collection of different flavored <b> Scooby Snacks </b> then <b>do not</b> bother contacting me. If you are unsure
        what a sufficient amount of dog treats is, then you don't have one.</p>
